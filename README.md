The SP0256-AL2 was originally avaialable in the early 1980s in speech add-ons for the VIC-20, Atari 8-bit computers, and the Tandy TRS-80.  Radio Shack sold the bare chip as the "Narrator Speech Processor".

The AY-3-8910 was first produced in 1978, and was in arcade and pinball games, the Intellivision and Vectrex game consoles, and in sound cards for the Apple II and TRS-80 Color Computer.
